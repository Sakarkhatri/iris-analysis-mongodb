# Iris Analysis with MongoDB

This project analyzes the Iris dataset using MongoDB for storage and retrieval. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning models for classification.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- MongoDB integration for data storage and retrieval
- Data visualization (correlation heatmap, species distribution)
- Implementation of machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Model comparison and analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- MongoDB
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, pymongo

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Ensure MongoDB is running on your system
4. Run the script: `python iris_analysis_mongodb.py`

## Results

The script will generate visualizations and print model comparison results in the console.
